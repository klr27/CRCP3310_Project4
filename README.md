# Data: Narrative, Meaning, and Discovery
## Relational Database Management Systems

Demonstrate the ability to create, read, update, and delete information stored within a relational database management system, by writing a program in Ruby or Python that interacts with a provided SQLite database. Create a program that enables the user to view data in the database, and to add new data to the database.

### Requirements:
1. Your program must use the provided SQLite database file.
2. The program should first present a menu of five options to the user: viewing all songs, adding a new genre, adding a new album, adding a new artist, and adding a new song. 
3. The program should then behave in accordance with the simple screen specification above.
4. Your program can be naïve in its error-handling. We can assume the user will enter valid input (eg. Won’t enter a “blank” genre name).
5. Your program should correctly create the song record as well as all necessary associations in the database, with albums, artists, and genres.
